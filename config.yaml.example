# Disable safety check for the output directory
# **Alternative**: DISABLE_SAFETY_CHECK environment variable

# If set to true, the script can clear directories without verifying the marker file.
disable_safety_check: false

# Override safety checks for the current run
# **Alternative**: OVERRIDE environment variable
# **Purpose**: Temporarily bypasses the safety check, allowing the script to clear the directory
# even if the marker file is missing.
# Useful for ad-hoc operations without changing the permanent safety check setting.
override: false

# Enable or disable HEIC to JPEG conversion
enable_heic_conversion: true

# Notes:
# - If both `disable_safety_check` and `override` are set to true, the script will ignore all directory safety mechanisms.
# - If both are set to false, the script will only operate on directories with a valid marker file.
